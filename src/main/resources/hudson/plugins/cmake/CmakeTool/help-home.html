    Path to the directory where the executables of the cmake suite reside. This can be <em>empty</em> to find the tools on the systemÂ´s
    executable search path (aka $PATH) or an absolute file system path.<p>
    If you have multiple build nodes, consider to let Jenkins install this tool
    for you automatically from cmake.org,
    </p>
    <p>Migration note: As of version 2.6.0, it is no longer possible to specify a tool name here (e.g. mingw32-cmake).
    Consider using a toolchain file instead.
