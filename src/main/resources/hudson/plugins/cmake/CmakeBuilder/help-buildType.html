Common values are blank, Debug, Release, RelWithDebInfo, and MinSizeRel. A blank value is
usually used with multi configuration generators such as Visual Studio. The Debug/Release values are
usually used with single configuration generators such as Ninja or Unix Makefiles.
<p>
If the value is not blank CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE will be set to the contents of this field at CMake configuration time.   
</p>
<p>
If you desire to use a custom build type you are able to do so. Custom build types follow the
pattern '^[a-zA-Z]+$'.  Any custom build type requires additional configuration in CMakeLists.txt.
Please see the CMake wiki for details on extending the default set of build types.
