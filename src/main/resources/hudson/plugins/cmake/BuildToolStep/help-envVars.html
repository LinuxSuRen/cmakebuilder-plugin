Specify extra environment variables to pass to the build tool as key-value pairs here.<br>
Each entry must be on its own line, for example:<br>
<code>DESTDIR=${WORKSPACE}/artifacts/dir<br>
KEY=VALUE</code>
<p>Please note that macros (e.g. <code>${WORKSPACE}</code>) will not be resolved by a pipeline script.</p>
